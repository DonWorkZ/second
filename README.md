# second

The course is called Basic Algorithms for undergraduate Computer Science majors at New York University!

Each programming project folder has the instructions in screenshots- as well as starter code. I did project 1- however, my code does not work. I also have project 2 due on Sunday night EST (eastern standard time).

I have attached my code that doesn't work from project 1 and would love if you could start by correcting that and reviewing the instructions for project 2.
